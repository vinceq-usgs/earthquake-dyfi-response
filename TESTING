For testing:

1. cd to the root of this repository
2. Run src/lib/pre-install
3. Run grunt

This will open three windows in your browser.
Files in the htdocs directory (e.g. index.php) will show up here:
http://localhost:8880/dyfi/index.php

Editing the files in src and test directories will automagically compile in the [repo]/.build/ directory.

When done, make sure to exit out of the 'grunt' process (Ctrl-C).

The default test data directory is [thisrepo]/test/data. Change this with the pre-install script.

Note for actual production, this repo should be installed in the application directory. The data directory should be in a separate directory.

To test with a live version of the DYFI questionnaire,
1. download the earthquake-eventpages repository, then 'npm install'
2. run src/lib/pre-install. For 'DYFI_RESPONSE_URL' enter the response port (i.e. http://localhost:8880/dyfi/index.php)
3. For Safari, make sure Develop->Disable ... Restrictions is on
4. Run grunt
5. Navigate to the DYFI form, and test from there.
