For testing:

1. cd to the root of this repository
2. Run 'src/lib/pre-install'
2.1. If this is the first time, you may have to run 'npm install' first
3. Run 'grunt'

This will open three windows in your browser.
Files in the htdocs directory (e.g. index.php) will show up here:
http://localhost:8880/dyfi/index.php

Editing the files in src and test directories will automagically compile in the [repo]/.build/ directory.

When done, make sure to exit out of the 'grunt' process (Ctrl-C).

The default test data directory is [thisrepo]/test/data. Change this with the pre-install script.

Note for actual production, this repo should be installed in the application directory. The data directory should be in a separate directory.

To test with a live version of the DYFI questionnaire,
1. download the earthquake-eventpages repository, then 'npm install'
2. run src/lib/pre-install. For 'DYFI_RESPONSE_URL' enter the response port (i.e. http://localhost:8880/response.php)
3. For Safari, make sure Develop->Disable ... Restrictions is on
4. Run grunt
5. Navigate to the DYFI form, and test from there.
